# Pair programming

## How to pair

In pair programming, two programmers work together at one
workstation. The *driver* types at the keyboard while the *navigator*
directs him. Even though the driver is at the keys, their role is the
more passive; the navigator directs the driver on what to type. The
driver executes his command.

The foundation of pair programming is communication. Partners must
always be communicating throughout. The navigator directs the driver,
but the driver will often need clarification about what the navigator
intends for him to do. When in disagreement, the pair needs to discuss
the proper course of action.

Alternating roles is critical. Use tomatoi.st to switch every 15min
("long break").

## Benefits of pair programming

There are a number of reasons we pair:

1. Pairs are a second pair of eyes. Since most novice mistakes are
   trivial, your pair has a greater chance of immediately identifying
   a problem that could have otherwise taken you a long time to
   discover.
2. Every student will learn different things outside of class; pairing
   is a way to bring that knowledge back into the class and share it
   with other students. This is one of the reasons we pair
   "promiscuously" (new pairs every project); we want everyone to
   benefit from everyone else's experience.
3. It is important to maintain focus throughout the class day. Working
   solo, it is easy to become distracted or zone out. Working in
   pairs, students help keep each other honest.
4. Working with other people is fun; we do a lot of coding, and it
   ought to be enjoyable.

## Pitfalls of pair programming

There are a few major pitfalls to avoid when pair programming:

If one of you is typing while the other quietly watches, you are doing
it wrong.

1. Use the timer to schedule switches. You must switch; each partner
   must have equal time in both roles.

2. The driver must not go off and start typing on his own, he must
   follow the navigator's instructions. Avoid being a domineering
   driver.
3. Likewise, the observer must be engaged, must ask plenty of
   questions, and must be comfortable making suggestions. Avoid being
   a passive observer.

**If one of you is typing away and the other is passively watching,
you are both doing it wrong**.
